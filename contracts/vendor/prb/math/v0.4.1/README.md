## PRB Math

- All files in the [`prb`](../../../prb/) directory are based on the [`@prb/math`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prb/math) NPM package, and as such is licensed under the MIT License: see [LICENSE](./LICENSE)

- No new code has been added. The only needed functionality was the one for `exponents` therefore we excluded all other folders and files from the NPM package.
